00:00.000 --> 00:11.680
Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.820
And I'm Beth.

00:12.820 --> 00:20.260
Many of those leading the fight against climate change are young people who feel betrayed by politicians and adults.

00:21.040 --> 00:29.440
In survey after survey, children report feeling that they have no future, that humanity is doomed and that governments are failing to act.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.340
This is causing many young people to feel worried about the state of the planet.

00:34.820 --> 00:37.660
There's even a name for it – climate anxiety.

00:37.720 --> 00:43.320
And it's also creating conflict between adults and children in families and schools.

00:43.740 --> 00:50.220
What's certain is that a solution to the climate emergency needs the cooperation of everyone, both old and young.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.960
So, can talking honestly about the climate help mend the divisions between generations?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.740
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme,

00:58.740 --> 01:00.900
along with some useful new vocabulary.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.800
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

01:04.380 --> 01:11.260
Many young people's hopes and fears about climate change are symbolised by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.180
These days, Greta travels the world speaking about the climate emergency,

01:16.660 --> 01:21.500
but her protests started much smaller in her hometown, Stockholm.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.640
So, how did Greta Thunberg's climate activism begin?

01:25.640 --> 01:26.640
Did she…

01:26.640 --> 01:30.040
A. Plant trees in her school garden.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.500
B. Skip school on Fridays.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.600
Or C. Recycle her school's plastic waste.

01:37.180 --> 01:41.920
I think Greta Thunberg went on strike and skipped school on Fridays.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.820
OK, Neil, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

01:46.460 --> 01:53.240
One recent survey showed that three-quarters or more of young people in the UK feel the future is frightening.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.100
Here, Immy, aged 14,

01:56.100 --> 01:57.680
and Millie, 11,

01:58.120 --> 02:01.100
share some of their fears with BBC Ideas.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.720
If climate change were like an animal or a plant,

02:04.840 --> 02:06.620
I think it'd be some sort of parasite,

02:07.240 --> 02:11.880
because it's the only thing that's actually growing and getting bigger

02:11.880 --> 02:14.640
while everything else starts dying off.

02:15.160 --> 02:18.500
I think climate change is, like, really scary,

02:18.820 --> 02:21.900
and the fact that lots of people aren't doing much about it

02:21.900 --> 02:23.480
just sort of freaks me out.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.080
The environment is definitely very special,

02:26.160 --> 02:29.220
because if we get rid of it, there's nowhere else we can go.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.440
Like, it's a very one-in-a-million sort of planet.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.640
Immy calls climate change a parasite.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.480
In the natural world, a parasite is an animal or plant

02:39.480 --> 02:42.500
that lives on another living thing and feeds from it.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.080
If you describe a person as a parasite,

02:45.420 --> 02:50.320
you mean they are lazy and live off other people supporting them or giving them money.

02:50.560 --> 02:55.740
Likewise, Immy thinks climate change is sucking the goodness out of the planet.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.940
And she uses a slang idiom to describe her feelings.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.820
It freaks me out.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.840
If something freaks you out,

03:03.940 --> 03:07.700
it makes you become very emotional, upset or confused.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.080
Millie agrees.

03:09.320 --> 03:14.020
What freaks her out is that governments don't seem to be doing much about the problem.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.580
It's not as if we can escape anywhere.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.140
Humankind only has one home – planet Earth.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.960
Millie calls Earth one in a million, meaning very special or rare.

03:25.540 --> 03:25.800
So,

03:25.800 --> 03:26.740
what can be done?

03:27.340 --> 03:31.460
Psychotherapist Caroline Hickman has visited ten countries around the world

03:31.460 --> 03:35.580
talking to over 100,000 teenagers about their climate fears.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.480
They told her about parents ignoring them when they wanted to discuss their feelings

03:40.480 --> 03:41.840
and adults telling them,

03:42.240 --> 03:44.200
fixing the planet is your job now.

03:44.940 --> 03:49.600
Here, she gives BBC Ideas some advice on discussing climate change with children.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.700
My advice to adults, parents, teachers is

03:54.700 --> 03:55.780
do not be afraid.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.380
Put it off.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.600
Don't push it away.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.640
Don't save it up and just have that big conversation.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.480
Talk about it regularly.

04:04.000 --> 04:04.900
That's crucial.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.800
And it's OK for you to say to your children,

04:07.940 --> 04:09.100
I don't have all the answers.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.840
We're not sure exactly how to deal with all of this.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.380
But let's find out together.

04:15.580 --> 04:19.340
Caroline's top tip is to discuss the climate crisis regularly,

04:19.340 --> 04:24.140
to talk with children about their climate fears and not put it off,

04:24.480 --> 04:25.720
not delay talking.

04:25.800 --> 04:31.100
Caroline also advises parents not to push it away,

04:31.500 --> 04:33.980
to choose to forget about or ignore the subject.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.980
A better response is to tell kids honestly.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.340
We don't have all the answers,

04:39.520 --> 04:42.640
but by sharing ideas we can work things out together.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.460
A more hopeful message,

04:44.760 --> 04:47.620
and one that's shared by climate champion Greta Thunberg.

04:48.020 --> 04:51.220
Yes, and it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.040
How did Greta Thunberg's climate activism begin, Neil?

04:55.040 --> 04:55.780
I said,

04:55.800 --> 04:57.920
I said it was by skipping school on Fridays.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.080
Which was the correct answer.

05:00.680 --> 05:05.280
Greta started her School Strike for Climate in August 2018,

05:05.820 --> 05:10.600
before it was taken up by over 1.6 million schoolchildren

05:10.600 --> 05:13.640
from 125 countries around the world.

05:14.160 --> 05:17.840
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme,

05:18.080 --> 05:20.000
starting with climate anxiety,

05:20.540 --> 05:24.580
feeling worried, afraid or depressed because of climate change.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.540
A parasite,

05:25.540 --> 05:29.000
is an animal or plant that feeds off another living thing.

05:29.460 --> 05:32.400
If something makes you feel very emotional or upset,

05:32.940 --> 05:33.700
you might say,

05:33.860 --> 05:35.100
it freaks me out.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.960
The idiom one in a million describes something

05:37.960 --> 05:41.200
which is extremely special, rare or unlikely.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.260
And finally, two phrasal verbs to finish with.

05:44.620 --> 05:45.620
To put something off,

05:45.820 --> 05:48.140
which means to delay doing it till later,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.300
and to push something away,

05:50.640 --> 05:53.700
which means to decide to forget about or ignore it.

05:53.700 --> 05:54.780

06:24.780 --> 06:30.620

06:30.920 --> 06:32.720
Be frightened by Frankenstein.

06:33.180 --> 06:35.200
Go into the woods with Hansel and Gretel

06:35.200 --> 06:37.580
and learn the story of the Pied Piper.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.560

06:43.320 --> 06:47.580
But his biggest idea is to bring a dead body to life.
